I have always been interested in technology that would make my life easier. Since a young age I have had an
affinity to exploring the unknown. Usually it involved disassembling some old hardware laying around the house
which would ultimately lead to a bunch of screws scattered throughout my room.

At the age of 12 I wanted to enter into the world of gaming PCs to explore this new revolution of HD gaming and
cool blinking lights. My first "gaming" PC arrived at the age of 14 in 2010; it was a hand-me-down from a closed
down company and included a nice big CRT screen, an Intel core 2 duo 1.8ghz with an awesome GeForce 6200. Ahh, the days...

During this time I unknowingly started my Linux journey with Ubuntu 8. I installed it without really knowing what
it was, but i fell in love. I thought to myself if only I could use Ubuntu instead of Windows. (Mind you I was 14, even back then I wanted to get rid of Windows)
          
I became really interested in hacking during this time (don't worry I didn't actually hack websites or anything) and started exploring ways to bomb pc's using cmd shell scripts. 
I ended up breaking into a family member's Thinkpad she still had from her previous job (she lost the password...) and used it to continue my journey of programming 
and Minecraft (ey don't judge). 
I started bringing this little banged up Thinkpad to my High School where at any free chance I would pluck it out of my bag and start doing random little things on it. 
It was such an old laptop and the keyboard used to pop-out - literally - and I had to pop it back in.

Fast forward to 2012, I had finally upgraded to a 1600x900 LED screen (long story short: got it cheap 
cause I helped repair some broken laptops). I then also got the GTX 1050 which later became a nice shelf
ornament after a cleaning accident in end of 2013 *cough*.
