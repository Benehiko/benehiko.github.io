I have always been interested in technology that would make my life easier. Since a young age, I have had an affinity for exploring the unknown. Usually, it involved disassembling some old hardware lying around the house which would ultimately lead to a bunch of screws scattered throughout my room.

At the age of 12, I wanted to enter into the world of gaming PCs to explore this new revolution of HD gaming and cool blinking lights. My first "gaming" PC arrived at the age of 14 in 2010; it was a hand-me-down from a closed down company and included a nice big CRT screen, an Intel core 2 duo 1.8ghz with an awesome GeForce 6200. Ahh, the days...

During this time I unknowingly started my Linux journey with Ubuntu 8. I installed it without really knowing what it was, but I fell in love. I thought to myself if only I could use Ubuntu for gaming instead of Windows (Even back then I wanted to get rid of Windows). I tried out WINE (Wine Is Not An Emulator) in pursuit of running games, but it was futile for young me at that stage.
          
I became interested in hacking during this time (don't worry I didn't hack websites or anything) and started exploring ways to bomb PC's using cmd shell scripts. I broke into a family member's Thinkpad she still had from her previous job (she lost the password...) in which I was rewarded with keeping it, so I used it for programming and playing Minecraft at school with friends using the laptop as a local server. 

I started bringing this little banged up, keyboard popping, Thinkpad (I took it apart at one stage) to my High School where at any free chance I would pluck it out of my bag and start doing random little things on it (like play around in Ubuntu 8).

During this time I was interested in HTML and CSS, but I always found something lacking and without much knowledge of code (besides Pascal Delphi) I wasn't sure what to look for. I started coming across .Net visual studios, but I didn't have much background at that stage to know what it was. 

Entering university in 2015, I spent most of my time gaming with friends and trying to start-up my little community using TeamSpeak and a PHP hosted website which I built to register people automatically to my password-protected TeamSpeak sever. 

The community fell apart as soon as Discord entered the market, offering free hosting and usage for anyone that knows how to click "Create a Server". Unfortunately, the website died and big dreams along with it. 

I started experimenting with Python and wrote [a small language translation bot](https://github.com/Benehiko/sirlancelot) for Discord which would translate any sentence at will using Yandex translator. 

Later in 2017, had to write a [PHP hosted website](https://github.com/Benehiko/Anzen-Learning) with a colleague (using some JQuery to implement a "slideshow" effect) for one of the lecturers at my campus. The goal of the website was to track who did "attend" the "online lecture" and who finished it. During the "slides" there would be some Google Forums embedded to fill in what you understood from the previous slides.

During this time I also took part in the study abroad exchange programme to Monash Malaysia for 6 months from June until January. Here I completed the 2nd year of my degree while travelling. 

In 2018 for my Industrial Experience project my team and I had to develop an ANPR Automatic Number Plate Recognition) system with manual intervention support (using an Android app). The system had to store images on a cloud database and present results on a web dashboard.

I am currently busy with my Honours programme writing a Thesis with the topic "Face Recognition". A demo can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LMNuJH0Rh0)
