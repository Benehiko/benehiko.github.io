Hi, I'm Alano and I enjoy creating, exploring and solving things in the software engineering space.
My skills are building systems (full stack) to solve a specific problem/need. I
usually prefer to only be busy with the software side of a project, but I do have experience with hardware (servers,
PC's, embedded etc). I work a lot with cloud hosting services such as Vm's, MySql Servers, Domains etc.

All my code is on GitHub for version control and as a backup. I also use (and create) a lot of open-source code and only rely on a paid solution as a last resort. This minimises
the cost to my clients while adding value to their products and services. 

I am good at researching and finding the answer to a problem I have no experience with. I enjoy learning 
new things and also open to being shown a better way.
          
Specific interests currently are Server-side software engineering (Golang, GraphQL, Spring Boot, Kotlin) as
well as Machine Learning projects in Python, Tensorflow and Keras. I focus my attention on Web-based
technology and automation.
