Hi, I'm Alano and I enjoy creating, exploring and solving things in the software engineering space.
My skills are building systems from scratch (full stack) - usually alone - to solve a specific problem. I
usually prefer to only be busy with the software side of a project, but I do have experience with hardware (servers,
pc's, embedded etc). I work a lot with cloud hosting services as well (Vm's, MySql Servers, Domains etc).
All my code is on GitHub for version control and backup.
          
Specific interests currently are Server-side software engineering (Golang, GraphQL, Spring Boot, Kotlin) as
well as Machine Learning projects in Python, Tensorflow and Keras. I focus my attention on Web-based
technology and automation.
