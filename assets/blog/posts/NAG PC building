Fast forward to 2012, I had finally upgraded to a 1600x900 LED screen (long story short: got it cheap because I helped repair some broken laptops). I then also got the GTX 650 which later became a nice shelf
ornament after a cleaning accident at the end of 2013 *cough*.

University starts in 2014 and I finally obtained a new R9 270x which I later changed out for the GTX 950 after getting 3rd place at an [overclocking competition at rAge](http://egmr.net/2015/10/rage-2015-nag-oc-workshop-winning-at-overclocking/). This is where the fun began as I had won an i7 6700k alongside an MSI M7 z270x gaming motherboard. 

In 2018 I updated to 2 HD Samsung screens, and since then I have been using this as my main driver (with some slight changes).
