### Why create it with Angular? ###

~~Using Angular to build a portfolio has it's positives, such as boasting about it to your friends ;)~~

Angular allows me to create a clean, responsive and dynamic website. Angular provides a way for me to load in assets from the disk or external resources (which is always a +) without needing to write jquery scripts. Serving a single-page website is also really pleasant since I don't need to write much HTML on each page to render correctly or to have a nav-bar. 

Others might argue that Angular is overkill for such a small use-case, and you probably are right. Responsiveness can be achieved with other frameworks, even only using HTML5 with Bootstrap will work just as well. The key thing about using Angular for me was that I already knew how to use it and wanted an easy way to load in posts without much formatting or updating of my code. 

Vue.Js and ReactNative both look like awesome frameworks to use, and I will probably dabble in them in the future - but alas, for now, I shall stick with Angular.

### The idea behind it ###

I wanted to create a portfolio & blogging website without coding a lot and without me needing to create a new HTML file every time I want to post something. "Now hold on a second" some of you might say. "There are websites for this exact thing!". Yes, yes I know. I'm a bit of an "I can do it myself" kind of guy. 

Setting up my portfolio and blogging site gives me full control over my code, the files I store and where I host it. There are frameworks, but they use complex backends and require some serious hosting. I didn't want a database or any unnecessary running costs.

The "extensibility" of it was a key factor in my decision of using Angular, so I went to search the web for answers. I later found a medium article (see sources) speaking of using Markdown files to create their blogging website. This made it easy to extend since a little bit of Markdown and it gets converted into HTML already formatted. 

### How long did it take me?

It took me about a day to get the hang of it and to find the best layout fiddling around with Bootstrap and Material Design. In total it has taken me just over 3 days to produce a well-formatted, responsive, dynamic website hosted on GitHub Pages with a custom domain handled by Cloudflare. Wow, that was a mouth-full. 

Ps.  I spend a lot of time overthinking things when I want it to be perfect. (It's a bad habit)
