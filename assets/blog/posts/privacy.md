## Privacy and Anonymity Online

### Preface
I have been wanting to investigate this topic for a while now since this ties in with freedom of speech and political policy not only in a certain country but all over the world. I must admit that I have not been following this topic close enough to have a deep understanding of it and I might also be wrong in my conclusions about what I perceive to be problems.

### Abstract
This article (I hope) is to inform others of what is currently happening in Government not only in South Africa or in a certain country, but as a global phenomenon. Although ethics and morality also play into this topic, the article will only focus on the Anonymity and Privacy of individuals on the Internet.

### Net Neutrality
 It has been in the news the past couple of years, especially in the US and other countries around the world wanting "Net Neutrality". A big proponent of this has been the Electronic Frontier Foundation (eff) for advocating for privacy on the internet. 

It seems that recently there has been an explosion of interest in VPN providers offering security and anonymity to users to either "hide" their connection details from so-called "hackers".  Although valid when connecting to public WiFi, most websites containing sensitive data use SSL certification to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. The only thing an SSL certificate can not grant is anonymity or privacy from meta-data. 

This is where VPNs comes in. VPNs "segregate" your connection from the public space; so think of a pipe (the internet) and another pipe inside this pipe (the VPN). Although this is a simplification of it, it helps us understand that VPNs just keep your connection apart from the rest of the network. In public spaces, this is often the case where bad actors are also on the same network, which means they could try intercept traffic from the network.
