### Why create it with Angular? ###

~~Using Angular to build a portfolio has it's positives, such as boasting about it to your friends ;)~~

To tell you the truth there isn't a proper answer, I just did it for the fun and wanted the website to look clean and responsive.
Angular isn't necessarily needed for that to be the case since static websites using only HTML 5 and Bootstrap can be a lot easier to create
and responsive. 

### The idea behind it ###

I wanted to create a portfolio & blogging website without coding a lot and without me needing to create a new HTML file every time I add a post.
The "extensibility" of it was a key factor in my decision, so I went to search the web for answers. I later found a medium article speaking
of using Markdown files to create their blogging website. This made it easy to extend since a little bit of Markdown and it gets converted
into HTML already formatted. 

### How long did it take me?

It took me about a day to get the hang of it and to find the best layout of my site. I spend a lot of time over thinking things when I 
want it to be perfect. (It's a bad habit)
